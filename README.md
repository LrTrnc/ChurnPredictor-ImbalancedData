# ChurnPredictor-ImbalancedData

Churn Prediction with Imbalanced Data

Overview
This project, titled "Handling Class Imbalance Problem in Churn Prediction," aims to develop sophisticated machine learning models for predicting customer churn in the telecommunications industry. The project addresses the challenge of class imbalance in predictive modeling, a common issue in machine learning datasets.

Objective
The primary goal is to create accurate predictive models and effective strategies for customer retention, focusing on balancing data and improving prediction accuracy.

Methodology
Data Preprocessing: Involves handling class imbalance using resampling techniques like SMOTE and Random Under Sampling.
Model Development: Training and evaluating various machine learning classifiers to identify the most effective methods for churn prediction.

Key Technologies
Machine Learning Libraries: Utilization of Python libraries including Pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn.
Classifiers: Implementation of advanced algorithms like CatBoost and LightGBM.
Tools: Usage of HyperOpt and Optuna for hyperparameter tuning.

Collaboration
The project involves collaboration between Computer Engineering and Management Engineering departments. While Computer Engineering focuses on data preprocessing and model development, Management Engineering applies the insights from these models to develop targeted promotional and campaign strategies.

Repository Contents
Code files for data preprocessing and model training.
Sample data file or structure (if original data is confidential or large).
Documentation including this README.md and project report.

Future Directions
